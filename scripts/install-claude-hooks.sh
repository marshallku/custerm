# install-claude-hooks.sh — wire Claude Code hook scripts to the nestty bus.
#
# Sentinel-based, idempotent. Users mark the patch point in their own
# hook scripts with:
#
#     # NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: <kind> [<json-payload>]
#
# and this script inserts a bus-publish line right after, bracketed by:
#
#     # NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH_END
#
# so re-runs are no-ops and `--uninstall` is a clean removal. The patch
# point stays under the user's control (you put the sentinel where the
# event semantically fires); the patcher just writes the mechanical
# `nestctl event publish ...` line.
#
# Usage:
#   install-claude-hooks.sh                # install across default dirs
#   install-claude-hooks.sh --dry-run      # show what would change
#   install-claude-hooks.sh --uninstall    # remove inserted blocks
#   install-claude-hooks.sh --hooks-dir P  # override scan path (repeatable)
#   install-claude-hooks.sh --self-test    # run unit tests, no fs changes
#
# Default scan dirs: ~/.claude/hooks and ~/.claude/scripts.
#
# See docs/harness-hooks.md for sentinel placement examples per hook.

# Sentinel grammar:
#   # NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: <kind> [<json-payload>]
#
# `<kind>` is the bus event kind (e.g. `claude.commit_blocked`).
# `<json-payload>` is optional; when omitted, `{}` is used. When
# present, it's a literal JSON string passed verbatim to `nestctl event
# publish`; shell-style `${VAR}` expansions inside it are expanded by
# the hook script at run-time (we DO NOT escape `${`).
