# Harness hooks ↔ nestty bus

How to wire Claude Code's hook scripts (`~/.claude/hooks/*.sh`,
`~/.claude/scripts/*.sh`) to the nestty event bus so triggers fire on
real harness events (commit blocked, codex review approved, session
stopped, …).

The trust boundary (decisions.md #37) is already enforced — only
triggers that opt in via `[triggers.security] accept_external = true`
receive events published from hook scripts. The pieces below are how
the hook scripts deliver those events.

## The sentinel approach

Hook scripts live in **your** dotfiles, so the patcher cannot guess the
right place to insert a publish call. You mark the call site with a
sentinel comment; the patcher just expands the sentinel into a real
`nestctl event publish` line. The patch is idempotent and reversible.

### Sentinel format

```
# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: <event-kind> [<json-payload>]
```

- `<event-kind>` is the bus event name (e.g. `claude.commit_blocked`).
  Must match the `[triggers.when] event_kind` of the trigger that
  receives it.
- `<json-payload>` is optional. Omit it for `{}`; provide a literal
  JSON object to ship fields the trigger can match on or interpolate.
  The payload is emitted **verbatim** to the patched line, so shell
  `${VAR}` expansion happens at hook-fire time. See the worked
  examples below.

### What the patcher writes

For each sentinel, `install-claude-hooks.sh` injects:

```
command -v nestctl >/dev/null && nestctl event publish <kind> --quiet "<payload>" &
# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH_END
```

immediately after the sentinel line. Three properties matter:

- `command -v nestctl` short-circuits when nestctl isn't installed —
  the hook never breaks on a fresh machine.
- `--quiet` makes `nestctl` exit 0 on transport failure (nesttyd down,
  socket missing). Schema errors still surface — your sentinel won't
  silently misbehave.
- `&` makes the publish fire-and-forget so the hook continues
  immediately without waiting on the daemon.

## Recommended placements

Match the sentinel to the moment in the script that semantically
corresponds to the event. The patterns below are tied to the trigger
examples shipped in `examples/triggers/claude-hooks.toml`.

### `~/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-gate.sh` → `claude.commit_blocked`

The script is a PreToolUse hook that vetoes commit/push commands when
the session hasn't been cross-reviewed. The deny path ends with a
`jq -n --arg msg "$REASON" '{permissionDecision: "deny", ...}'` line.
Put the sentinel one line **above** that final jq:

```bash
# … existing logic that resolves $REASON …

# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: claude.commit_blocked {"reason":"$REASON","repo":"$REPO"}
jq -n --arg msg "$REASON" '{permissionDecision: "deny", message: $msg}'
```

After `install-claude-hooks.sh`:

```bash
# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: claude.commit_blocked {"reason":"$REASON","repo":"$REPO"}
command -v nestctl >/dev/null && nestctl event publish claude.commit_blocked --quiet "{\"reason\":\"$REASON\",\"repo\":\"$REPO\"}" &
# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH_END
jq -n --arg msg "$REASON" '{permissionDecision: "deny", message: $msg}'
```

The `$REASON` / `$REPO` shell vars are expanded by the hook process at
fire time. The trigger receives a payload with concrete strings, ready
for `{event.reason}` interpolation in `notify.show`.

### `~/.claude/scripts/codex-review.sh` → `claude.review_approved`

The script's success path is the `VERDICT: APPROVED` branch that calls
`mark_repo_reviewed`. Put the sentinel right inside that branch:

```bash
case "$VERDICT_LINE" in
    "VERDICT: APPROVED")
        if [[ "$MODE" != "files" ]]; then
            mark_repo_reviewed
        fi
        # NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: claude.review_approved {"session":"$SESSION","mode":"$MODE"}
        exit 0
        ;;
```

The trigger fires on every successful review — a tiny toast confirming
the codex pass landed before the commit gate releases.

### Other hooks (slice 2 candidates)

Trigger examples for these are not yet shipped, but the same sentinel
shape works:

| Hook script | Event kind | When |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/hooks/track-edit.sh` | `claude.tool_used` | PostToolUse on every Edit/Write |
| `~/.claude/hooks/auto-handoff.sh` | `claude.session_stopped` | Stop hook, session wrap-up |
| `~/.claude/hooks/auto-cross-review.sh` | `claude.review_required` | Stop with dirty changes |
| `~/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` | `claude.session_started` | SessionStart |

When a corresponding `examples/triggers/claude-*` trigger lands in
slice 2, the recommended placement docs here will expand.

## Running the patcher

```bash
# Default — scan ~/.claude/hooks and ~/.claude/scripts.
bash ~/dev/nestty/scripts/install-claude-hooks.sh

# Dry-run — print diffs without writing.
bash ~/dev/nestty/scripts/install-claude-hooks.sh --dry-run

# Remove all injected publish blocks (leaves sentinels in place for
# easy re-install).
bash ~/dev/nestty/scripts/install-claude-hooks.sh --uninstall

# Use a non-default hook layout.
bash ~/dev/nestty/scripts/install-claude-hooks.sh --hooks-dir ~/dotfiles/claude/hooks
```

The patcher's self-test (`--self-test`) runs in a tmpdir and never
touches `~/.claude`. Useful for CI or a smoke check after editing the
script.

## Manual patch path

If you don't want the patcher, the literal lines below are what gets
written. Copy them into your hook by hand:

```bash
# Just below the place the event fires, paste:
command -v nestctl >/dev/null && nestctl event publish \
    claude.commit_blocked --quiet \
    "{\"reason\":\"$REASON\",\"repo\":\"$REPO\"}" &
```

You don't need the sentinel comments at all if you're maintaining the
patch by hand — they only exist so the patcher can find and update the
line.

## Payload safety — when `$VAR` values may contain JSON-special chars

The patcher escapes the **literal** `"` and `\` characters from your
sentinel payload so the emitted bash line parses correctly. It cannot
escape the *runtime* expansion of `${VAR}` — if `$REASON` itself
contains a `"`, a `\`, a newline, or any other JSON-special character,
the resulting JSON is broken:

```bash
# Sentinel:
# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: claude.commit_blocked {"reason":"$REASON"}
# Patched line:
... --quiet "{\"reason\":\"$REASON\"}" &
# At fire time with REASON='bad "value':
... --quiet "{"reason":"bad "value"}" &   # broken JSON
# At fire time with REASON='C:\tmp':
... --quiet "{"reason":"C:\tmp"}" &       # `\t` becomes a tab char
```

The same hazard hits any runtime value that contains:

- `"` — breaks the JSON string boundary.
- `\` — bash treats `\X` inside `"..."` as an escape sequence
  (`\t`, `\n`, `\\` collapses, etc.), changing the byte stream.
- newlines / control characters — produce literal control bytes
  rather than JSON `\n` / `\t` escapes.

Enum-like values, integer ids, and ASCII-only identifiers (`$SESSION`,
`$VERDICT`, etc.) are safe to embed directly because they contain none
of the above. For anything that captures user-controlled or
filesystem-derived strings (Slack message text, Discord nicknames,
filesystem paths, multi-line outputs), construct the payload via a
JSON-safe builder:

**Option A — `jq` (recommended when available):**

```bash
# Sentinel:
# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: claude.commit_blocked $(jq -n --arg r "$REASON" --arg p "$REPO" '{reason:$r,repo:$p}')
# Patched line:
... --quiet "$(jq -n --arg r "$REASON" --arg p "$REPO" '{reason:$r,repo:$p}')" &
```

`jq -n --arg` quotes the value into a JSON string and escapes anything
inside. The `$(...)` substitution is preserved verbatim by the
patcher.

**Option B — a small bash helper (zero deps):**

Add this once at the top of your hook script:

```bash
# JSON-encode "k=v" pairs into a single object, escaping `"`/`\`/CR/LF.
nestty_json() {
    local out='{' first=1 kv k v esc
    while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
        kv="$1"; shift
        k="${kv%%=*}"; v="${kv#*=}"
        esc="${v//\\/\\\\}"; esc="${esc//\"/\\\"}"
        esc="${esc//$'\n'/\\n}"; esc="${esc//$'\r'/\\r}"
        [[ $first -eq 1 ]] && first=0 || out+=,
        out+="\"$k\":\"$esc\""
    done
    out+='}'
    printf '%s' "$out"
}
```

Then:

```bash
# Sentinel:
# NESTTY_HOOK_PUBLISH: claude.commit_blocked $(nestty_json "reason=$REASON" "repo=$REPO")
```

Both keep the patch idempotent (the `$(...)` substitution is captured
by the patcher verbatim).

- The `jq` path is fully safe — every JSON-special and control char
  is escaped by `jq -n --arg`.
- The zero-deps `nestty_json` helper covers the common cases (`"`,
  `\`, LF, CR). Other control bytes (literal tab, NUL, etc.) end up
  in the JSON unescaped, which is a spec violation. Hooks that may
  capture raw control bytes (e.g. ANSI-stripped subprocess output)
  should prefer `jq` or extend `nestty_json` with the `printf
  '\\u%04x'` pattern for `$'\x00'..$'\x1f'`.

## Verifying the flow end-to-end

After patching, you can simulate without waiting for a real hook fire:

```bash
# 1. Confirm the trigger is loaded.
nestctl recent --since 1m --kind 'system.*'

# 2. Publish the event yourself.
nestctl event publish claude.commit_blocked --quiet \
    '{"reason":"manual test","repo":"demo"}'

# 3. Watch for the toast (notify-send / osascript fires it).
# Also check daemon logs for the trigger fire line:
journalctl --user -u nesttyd --since "10s ago" 2>/dev/null \
    || tail -n 20 /tmp/nesttyd*.log
# Expected: trigger "claude-commit-blocked-toast" fired action "notify.show"
```

If the toast doesn't appear:

- **No log line** → trigger not matching. Verify `[triggers.when]
  event_kind` matches the kind you published, and `[triggers.security]
  accept_external = true` is present.
- **Log line present but no toast** → `notify.show` subprocess
  failure. Run the same call directly: `nestctl call notify.show
  --params '{"title":"t","body":"b"}'` and check daemon logs for
  `notify subprocess` errors. Notification server (dunst/mako/
  gnome-shell) misconfiguration is the usual cause.
- **`nestctl: command not found`** → install nestty
  (`./scripts/install-dev.sh`) or check PATH.

## Trust boundary recap

Events published from these hooks are tagged `Origin::External` by the
daemon's `events.publish` handler. The fan-out filter in
`TriggerEngine::dispatch` drops External events for triggers without
`accept_external = true`. The privileged-action gate
(`allow_privileged`) is a separate opt-in for triggers that fire
`system.spawn`. See `docs/harness-integration.md` § Trust boundary and
`docs/decisions.md` #37 for the full design.

In practice: if you copy the trigger examples from
`examples/triggers/claude-hooks.toml`, both security flags are set
correctly. If you author your own trigger, remember the two-step
opt-in for the dangerous hook-event-fires-spawn combo.
